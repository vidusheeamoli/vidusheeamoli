## Hello 👋🏽 👩🏽‍💻

I am Vidushee Amoli (she/her), a senior Computer Science undergrad who is passionate about OSS, creating technology to elevate under-represented people, web development, data structures and algorithms.
I value diversity and inclusion. ✨

After working at Homebrew this summer as a part of the Google Summer of Code program, I'm now an open source maintainer at Homebrew! 🍺 

Apart from academics and writing code, I like to spend my time learning French, browsing r/eyebleach, and playing with my precious pupper, [Poe](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Eg56sZzUcAAkzm6?format=jpg&name=large). 🐶

📫 Feel free to connect with me via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vidusheeamoli)!

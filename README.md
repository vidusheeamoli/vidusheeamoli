## Hello 👋🏽 👩🏽‍💻

I am Vidushee Amoli (she/her), a senior Computer Science undergrad who is passionate about OSS, creating technology to elevate under-represented people, web development, data structures and algorithms.
I value diversity and inclusion. ✨

I am currently working as a Software Engineering Intern at HackerRank and an open source maintainer at Homebrew, where I was a part of the Google Summer of Code program.

Apart from academics and writing code, I like to spend my time learning French, browsing r/eyebleach, and playing with my precious pupper, [Poe](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Eg56sZzUcAAkzm6?format=jpg&name=large). 🐶

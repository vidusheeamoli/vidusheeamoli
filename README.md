## Hello!

👋🏽 I'm Vidushee, a passionate and result-driven software engineer currently pursuing my graduate studies in computer science at the **University of California, Irvine**. I thrive on solving complex engineering problems and leveraging technology to drive innovation.

👩🏽‍💻 Prior to joining UCI, I worked at **Grab** as a full-time software engineer for 2 years. Before that, I interned at **HackerRank** (2021) and **Clarisights** (2019) and also took part in the **Google SoC** programme in 2020 with Homebrew, where I later joined the team as an open-source maintainer.

💼 Currently, I'm seeking software engineering internship opportunities for Summer 2024 that allow me to apply and expand my technical skills, innovate, and make a positive impact! My dedication to diversity and inclusion drives me to contribute to workplaces that foster creativity and innovation.

📧 Feel free to connect with me at vamoli@uci.edu. Let's explore opportunities and collaborate on exciting projects together!
